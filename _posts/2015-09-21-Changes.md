So, switching to a new template. The old one was too minimal. 

This one has better features and is easier to tweak. Not sure if 
anything comes after this post, but I will probably fiddle with 
the css a bit more and work on the markdow/html of the posts.
    
*This Jekyll theme was crafted by by [John Otander](http://johnotander.com/)*

Only customizations up to now:
- use github flavoured markdown
- remove some of the footers
- remove emailing contact form
