Another blog engine, this time a pretty simple one. Based on writing Markdown files, which makes it a really quick and easy to post new content.
  
Setup:  
- [Github repo](https://github.com/henkmeulekamp/henkmeulekamp.github.io) for content/site  
- [Github Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/)  
- Poole for basic jekyll setup: [Poole](http://getpoole.com)  
- Lanyon theme for poole: [Lanyon](http://github.com/poole/lanyon)  
- Code; Markdown editor: [vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
- Notepadd++; when Code annoys to much (Code has quirks): [Notepadd++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download)
